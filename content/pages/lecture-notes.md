Module 1: Genome Engineering
----------------------------

Instructors: Prof. Drew Endy, Dr. Natalie Kuldell, and Dr. Agi Stachowiak  
Lecturer: Prof. Drew Endy  
TA: Laure-Anne Ventouras

In this experiment, we will consider the genome of a virus, namely the bacteriophage M13. M13 is a self-assembling nano-machine with a compact genome that has been optimized by evolution to commandeer its bacterial host. Approximately 1000 new viruses are generated from a single infection event. Imagine harnessing this production. What could we build and what natural processes could we better understand? One approach we'll take is to modify the existing genome in a subtle but useful way, namely by adding a useful sequence-tag that modifies the bacteriophage coat. We'll examine how this modification affects the coat protein's expression and overall phage production. Another approach we'll take is to start from scratch, undertaking a full throttle redesign of the bacteriophage genome. We'll employ a commercial DNA synthesis company to compile the redesigned genomic program and then we'll see if it encoded infective M13 and if the genome of the bacterial host affects bacteriophage production. Through these investigations we'll ask: is nature's M13 genome "perfect" or can we do better?

Module 2: Expression Engineering
--------------------------------

Instructors: Dr. Natalie Kuldell and Dr. Agi Stachowiak  
Lecturer: Dr. Natalie Kuldell  
TA: Alice Lo

In this experiment, we will consider unintended and unpredicted effects of an experimental perturbation. Our goal is a precise one, namely to silence gene expression of a measurable gene, luciferase, using RNA interference (RNAi). Each group will begin by designing a short interfering RNA (siRNA) against luciferase, but as we'll see, siRNAs can vary in efficacy and specificity. After transfecting a mammalian cell line with the siRNA you've designed and a reporter plasmid, we will evaluate the silencing using a luciferase assay and microarray technology. The first assay evaluates the efficacy of the siRNA in silencing. The second assay gives genome-wide expression data to reveal the specificity of your siRNA for the gene you've targeted. Through this combined approach, we'll assess the balance of targeted and off-target effects.
